# System Description
The current system is intended to be a lightweight web app, thus it has been built in the form of a Single Page Application (SPA). 
The user interface has no back-end API to the Energy Management System (EMS), therefore dummy data has been used for generating the graph on the Schedule page. 
The user needs to connect to the system using a QR code.
